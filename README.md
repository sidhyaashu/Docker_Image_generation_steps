## **Project Overview**

*Provide a detailed overview of the project. Explain the problem it solves, its intended audience, and any key technologies or frameworks used.*

## **Features**

- List major features of the project.
- Include any unique selling points or standout capabilities.
- Mention if the project supports multiple environments or platforms.

## **Docker Environments**

### **Docker Environment Variables**

Docker environment variables are key-value pairs that you can set to configure the behavior of Docker containers. Common environment variables include:

- `ENV`: Used to set environment variables in a Dockerfile.
- `ARG`: Used to define build-time variables in a Dockerfile.
- `DOCKER_HOST`: Specifies the URL of the Docker daemon.
- `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`: Enables or disables TLS verification for Docker commands.
- `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`: Specifies the path to the client certificate files used for TLS verification.

### **Docker Compose Environment**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. Common settings include:

- `version`: The version of the Compose file format.
- `services`: Define the services (containers) to be created.
- `volumes`: Defines volumes for data persistence.
- `networks`: Defines custom networks for service communication.

### **Dockerfile Configuration**

Dockerfile is a script with a set of instructions to create a Docker image. Important instructions include:

- `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
- `ENV`: Sets environment variables within the image.
- `RUN`: Executes commands in a new layer.
- `CMD`: Provides default commands for the container.
- `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports.

### **Volumes and Networks**

- **Volumes**: Used for data persistence. Can be defined using the `-v` flag in `docker run` or in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Networks**: Used for container communication. Can be defined using the `--network` flag or in `docker-compose.yml`.

### **Docker Contexts**

Docker contexts allow you to switch between multiple Docker environments, such as different Docker daemons (local, remote, cloud). Commands include:

- `docker context create`: Create a new context.
- `docker context use`: Switch to a specific context.
- `docker context ls`: List all available contexts.

## **Prerequisites**

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) version X.X.X or higher
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (if applicable)
- Any other tools or dependencies
